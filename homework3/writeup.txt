This product is a web that shows the dashboard of the web crawler. 
We use C# to crawl and index the information we need from www.cnn.com
Here is the implements for this assignment:

Data is hosted on Azure. We have two queue storages and one table storage to store the information we need.

For the web role:
	=> dashboard.aspx
	I have the dashboard that shows:
		State of each worker role web crawler (save on the table storage)
		CPU Utilization%, RAM available (get it using performanceCounter)
		#URLs crawled 
		Last 10 URLs crawled
		Size of queue (get the size of the urlqueue storage)
		Size of index (get the size of the table storage)
		errors URLs (get the url that has been visited or disallow by the robot.txt)
		
	I put ajax call link to the webservice called admin.asmx to get the POST request and display on the index.html
	
	=>admin.asmx
	I use admin.asmx to test the class I wrote and also use ajax to get request.
	On the admin web service, I have clearIndex that stop the crawling and clear all of my storage.
	The startCrawling enable me to send a message to my commandqueue to request start.
	The GetPageTitle can get the title of the given url from the table storage.
	
For the worker role:
   The worker role help us to run crawlers again and again. It sleep 10000ms, wake up and get the commandqueue message from commandqueue
   and loopback. Then it gets the message from the urlqueue and use the class to filter the url and get title. After getting pagetitle, I out the url and title into the table storage.
   I use the HashSet to save the visitedurl and queue to save the disallow syntax from the getrobot class. 
   Then I remove the invalid url from allurl list based on the sidallow queue and visitedurl hashSet.
   Then I saved the valid urls into my url queue.
